                <h3>New Local Region? Tips To Get Started</h3>
                <p>
                  Successful projects are always seeking to scale business
                  operations and increase the number of active users. Joining a
                  new region is one of the most powerful ways to attract new
                  clients and maximize revenue. <br />
                  <br />
                  Products or solutions designed for international markets scale
                  business by entering new markets with a vast audience.
                  According to Wikipedia, more than 470 million people speak
                  Spanish. Spanish is the second most used language after
                  Chinese. Let's consider the best marketing strategies to get
                  massive awareness for your brand in Spanish-speaking countries
                  in 2022.
                </p>

                <h3>How to get started</h3>
                <p>
                  The first step is the development of a product promotion
                  strategy. Brands should take into account the local specifics
                  of the target region. We recommend onboarding a native speaker
                  who lives or has lived in the region your company plans to
                  capture. <br />
                  <br />
                  It is necessary to study the tactics used by main competitors
                  and conduct research to identify insights on how to promote
                  content in the target region.
                </p>
                <br />
                <br />
                <h3 className="m-0">
                  {" "}
                  Research of target audience and competitors
                </h3>
                <h4>What do we mean by research?</h4>
                <p>
                  It is the task of exploring information related to the
                  behaviors of potential users –– the people who'll use your
                  product.
                </p>
                <h4>
                  Why is it necessary to provide market (user/competitor)
                  research?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Because no one on the team can position themselves as the
                  client and know for certain how the product looks in the eyes
                  of the client from the local region, competitor research is
                  necessary. <br />
                  <br />
                  This is due to the fact that the team knows more about their
                  product than the potential user and simply cannot forget about
                  this knowledge. Therefore, all conclusions and arguments are
                  not subjective. <br />
                  <br />
                  The only way to get unbiased information is to conduct proper
                  research.
                </p>
                <br />
                <br />
                <h3>What are the main criteria? </h3>
                <p>
                  - If the product does not yet have customers, then based on
                  the primary data from the customer, select all possible
                  segments that logically fit into the necessary criteria.{" "}
                  <br />
                  <br />- Search the Internet for available information on how
                  representatives of selected segments behave in relation to
                  products similar to ours. For example, we read reviews on
                  competitors, read forums, look at comments on articles, study
                  competitors' social networks, what subscribers like / dislike,
                  and look for the results of previous studies. <br />
                  <br />
                  - Based on the information we collected from the points above,
                  we put forward hypotheses regarding the various
                  characteristics of the target segments (attitude towards the
                  product, what is important for clients in the product, how
                  they choose, what to fear, etc.) <br />
                  <br />
                  - Draw up hypotheses in the form of a list of questions with
                  ready-made answers and invite representatives of the target
                  audience to take a survey. Alternatively, look for respondents
                  for a voice interview. Respondents most often need
                  remuneration for completing a survey of, on average, 5-10$
                  (depending on the length of the survey). For an interview, a
                  more significant bonus may be necessary –– we use a guideline
                  of 50$. <br />
                  <br />
                  - Based on the survey answers, we improve the hypotheses and
                  take them as a basis to shape the positioning. <br /> <br />
                  - Using this method, we find out much more accurately what the
                  target audience needs, how they see the product, and how we
                  should promote it. <br />
                  <br />
                </p>
                <h4 className="mt-2">How do we provide competitor research?</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    We study the target market and make a list of the most

                  <li>Study positioning</li>
                  <li>
                    We analyze the community of competitors on different

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We analyze the activity of community managers and social

                </ul>
                <h4 className="mt-2">What do we receive as a result? </h4>

                  <li>We understand what the target audience really needs</li>
                  <li>We know what competitors offer to our target audience</li>
                  <li>
                    We position ourselves using competitive advantages according
                    to the criteria that are highly regarded by the target
                    audience
                  </li>

                    Increase revenue, conversions, sign-up rate, and LTV. The
                    research helps to increase brand presence and awareness.
                    This is the most critical part of the brand's long-term
                    presence in the target region.

                </ul>
                <br />
                <br />
                <p>
                  As you may have noticed, providing the research is a complex
                  task, but it helps if brands to do the first steps and approve
                  the profitable marketing direction, which can save budget and
                  get loyal clients.

                <br />
                <h3>Product localization </h3>
                <p>
                  Brands that join new local regions should localize their
                  products to increase the client acquisition rate. Most users
                  from foreign countries do not use English as their primary
                  language. That's why it's crucial to provide users with the
                  correct information regarding your product in their preferred
                  language.
                </p>
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <h3>Сommunity building</h3>
                <p>
                  After the localization of the product, it's time to create a
                  strong brand community. Based on the specificity of your
                  product and preferred region, the target community could
                  aggregate on messenger apps or social media. Telegram &
                  Facebook are the most popular messenger applications in
                  Spanish-speaking countries, particularly in Latin America.
                  Therefore, the next step is to set up the brand group, provide
                  regular content, hire a community manager, and implement a
                  community growth strategy. <br />
                  <br />
                  The selection of chat admins is critical, and their work
                  should not be underestimated. An intelligent admin will allow
                  brands to achieve widespread user retention. <br />
                  <br />
                  The content plan should be prepared in advance. The content
                  should be published every day, including all product updates.
                  Leading brands provide AMA sessions, engagement giveaways, and
                  other incentives inside of the community. <br />
                  <br />
                  In the next step, we onboard target users in the brand
                  community through influencer marketing, digital marketing, and
                  CPA marketing. <br />
                  <br />
                  Influencer marketing is the most conventional type of
                  marketing campaign for community building. Choose the
                  influencers you want to advertise with very carefully. There
                  are many software solutions on the market, like
                  https://hypeauditor.com/ and https://www.noxinfluencer.com/.
                  We recommend analyzing each influencer to avoid fraud
                  activity. <br />
                  <br />
                  An effective advertising campaign should proceed for at least
                  one month, with regular publications at least 10-15 per week
                  on the brand's social media and 20+ publications provided by
                  target influencers. <br />
                  <br />
                  After successfully shaping a brand community, it's time to
                  organize an offline brand event. Brand events increase the
                  level of credibility. The most loyal community participants
                  are perfectly fit to support the marketing growth in the
                  region. Upon conclusion of these main points, readers will be
                  equipped to address the challenge of discovering new local
                  regions.

                  SEO is the marketing strategy every website needs to include
                  and improve over the long term. It provides organic traffic
                  that can lead to a high return per click. It is not an easy
                  job, but in 2022 a website that is not SEO optimized does not
                  stand a chance on google.
